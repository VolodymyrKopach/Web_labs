            <h1 class="in_center">Parkour</h1>
            <p>Parkour is a training discipline using movement that developed from military obstacle course training.
                Practitioners aim to get from one point to another in a complex environment, without assistive equipment
                and in the fastest and most efficient way possible. Parkour includes running, climbing, swinging,
                vaulting, jumping, rolling, quadrupedal movement (crawling) and other movements as deemed most suitable
                for the situation. Parkour's development from military training gives it some aspects of a non-combative
                martial art.
            <p> Parkour is an activity that can be practiced alone or with others and is usually carried out in urban
                spaces, though it can be done anywhere. Parkour involves seeing one's environment in a new way, and
                imagining the potential for navigating it by movement around, across, through, over and under its
                features.
            <p> Parkour was developed in France, primarily by Raymond Belle, and further by his son David and the
                latter's group of friends, the self-styled Yamakasi, during the late 1980s. The discipline was
                popularised in the late 1990s and 2000s through films, documentaries, and advertisements featuring the
                Yamakasi.

            <h2 class="in_center">Etymology</h2>
            <p>The word parkour derives from parcours du combattant (obstacle course), the classic obstacle course
                method of military training proposed by Georges Hebert. Raymond Belle used the term "les parcours" to
                encompass all of his training including climbing, jumping, running, balancing, and the other methods he
                undertook in his personal athletic advancement. His son, David, further developed his father's methods
                and achieved success as a stuntman, and one day on a film set showed his 'Speed Air Man' video to Hubert
                Kounde. Kounde suggested he change the "c" of "parcours" to a "k" because it was stronger and more
                dynamic, and to remove the silent "s" for the same reason, forming "parkour".
            <p>A practitioner of parkour is called a traceur, with the feminine form being traceuse. They are nouns
                derived from the French verb tracer, which normally means "to trace", as in "tracing a path", in
                reference to drawing. The verb tracer used familiarly means: "to buck up". The term traceur was
                originally the name of a parkour group headed by David Belle which included Sebastien Foucan and
                Stephane Vigroux.
            <p> A jam refers to a meeting of traceurs, involving training lasting anywhere from hours to several days,
                often with people from different cities. The first parkour jam was organised in July 2002 by Romain
                Drouet, with a dozen people including Sebastien Foucan and Stephane Vigroux.
